## Who I am

Hello! I am Vidushan :smile:

I am a 24 years old Software Engineer based in Paris. When I'm not coding, I will usually spend my time by playing video games, watching anime or sharing moments with my cousins and my family.

## What is this website about

This website will mainly host my blog on which I aim to share posts about tech (tools I use or I have discovered), but also about my hobbies. Creating and maintaining this website is also a way for me to improve my skills with ReactJS, a library that I love!
