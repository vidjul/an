      <h2>Who I am</h2>

      <p>
        Hello, I am Vidushan! ðŸ‘‹
        <br />
        <br />I am a 26 years old Software Engineer based in Paris. When
        I&apos;m not coding, I will usually spend my time playing video games,
        watching anime, or sharing moments with my cousins and family.
      </p>

      <h2>What is this website about</h2>

      <p>
        This website will mainly host my blog, on which I aim to share posts
        about tech (tools I use or I have discovered) and my hobbies. Creating
        and maintaining this website is also a way for me to improve my skills
        with ReactJS, a library that I love!
      </p>
